# Sequence Distance Graph examples

This page contains examples for the  [Sequence Distance Graph framework](https://github.com/bioinfologics/sdg).



### Datasets

All the datasets used on these examples are described on the [datasets](datasets/datasets.md) page.

### Basic tasks

The first thing you will need to use SDG is to [create a WorkSpace](creating_workspaces/creating_workspaces.md).

### Walkthroughs

The [SDG First Steps Walkthrough](first_steps.md) is a great place to start.

[LinkageMaker and LinkageUntangler](linkage/linkagemaker_linkageuntangler.md) is an overview of SDG's scaffolding capabilities, right now with a single Long-reads scaffolding of a short-read graph.

[Exploring a short-read trio simulation with KmerCounts](trio/trio_pe.md) shows how bubble analysis and parental sequence origin can be explored in SDG.
